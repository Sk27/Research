- Samuel Finley Breese Morse was born in 1791 in Charleston, Massachusetts
- In th e year of Morse's birth, Catherine the Great rule d R ussi a. Louis XVI an d Marie An toin erre wo uld lose their
heads two years later in the French Revolution. And in 17911 , Mozart completed
The Magic Flute, his last opera, and died later that year at the age
of 35.
- Morse was educated at Yale and studied art in London. He became a successful portrait artist.
- His painting General Lafayette (1825) hangs in New York's City Hall.
- But these are just footnotes to an eclectic career. Samuel F. B. Morse is best
known these days for his invention of the telegraph and the code that bears
his name.
- The idea of the telegraph (literally meaning " far writing") was certainly
in the air in the early 1 800s, and other inventors had taken a stab at it before
Samuel Morse began experimenting in 1832
- If you take an iron bar, wrap it with a couple hundred turns of thin wire,
and then run a current through the wire, the iron bar becomes a magnet. It
then attracts other pieces of iron and steel. (There's enough thin wire in the
electromagnet to create a resistance great enough to prevent the electromagnet
from constituting a short circuit.) Remove the current, and the iron
bar loses its magnetism:
- The electromagnet is the foundation of the telegraph. Turning the switch on
and off at one end causes the electromagnet to do something at the other end.
Morse's first telegraphs were actually more complex than the ones that
later evolved.
- Although Samuel Morse notified the patent office in 1 836 that he had
invented a successful telegraph, it wasn't until 1 843 that he was able to
persuade Congress to fund a public demonstration of the device. The historic
day was May 24, 1 844, when a telegraph line rigged between Washington,
D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, successfully carried the biblical
message: "What hath God wrought! "
- It's an interesting fantasy, but in reality Samuel Morse had understood the
concept of this device early on. The device we've invented is called a repeater,
or a relay. A relay is like a sounder in that an incoming current is used to
power an electromagnet that pulls down a metal lever. The lever, however,
is used as part of a switch connecting a battery to an outgoing wire. In this
way, a weak incoming current is "amplified" to make a stronger outgoing
current.
- The relay is a remarkable device. It's a switch, surely, but a switch that's
turned on and off not by human hands but by a current. You could do
amazing things with such devices. You could actually assemble much of a
computer with them.
