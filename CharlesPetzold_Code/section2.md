**The prevailing scientific wisdom regarding the workings of electricity is
called the electron theory, which says that electricity derives from the movement of electrons.**

- all matter-the stuff that we can see and feel (usually)-is
  made up of extremely small things called atoms. Every atom is composed of three types of particles.
- These are called neutrons, protons, and electrons
- There are 112 elements, each of which has a particular atomic number ranging from 1 to 112.
- The atomic number indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of each of the element's atoms and also (usually) the number of electrons in each atom. The atomic number of lithium is 3.
- Atoms can chemically combine with other atoms to form molecules
- Molecules usually have very different properties from the atoms they comprise. For example, water is composed of molecules that consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen (hence, H20). Obviously water
  is appreciably different from either hydrogen or oxygen. Likewise, the
  molecules of table salt consist of an atom of sodium and an atom of chlorine, neither of which would be particularly appetizing on French fries.
  Hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine are all elements. Water and salt
  are called compounds. Salt water, however, is a mixture rather than a compound because the water and the salt maintain their own properties
- The number of electrons in an atom is usually the same as the number of
  protons. But in certain circumstances, electrons can be dislodged from atoms. That's how elecuicity happens.
  The words electron and electricity both derive from the ancient Greek
  word TJAEKTpov (elektron)
- (elektron) is a Greek word for "amber", which is the glasslike hardended sap of trees. The reason for this
  unlikely derivation is that the ancient Greeks experimented with rubbing
  amber with wool, which produces something we now call static electricity
- Protons and electtons have a characteristic called charge. Protons arc said
  to have a positive (+) charge and electrons are said to have a negative (-)
  charge. Neutrons are neutral and have no charge. Protons and electrons are happiest and most stable when they exist together in equal numbers. An imbalance of protons and electrons will attempt
  to correct itself
- Static electricity ins't limited to the little sparks produced by fingers touching doorknoobs. During storms, bottom clouds acummulate electrons while upper clouds lose electrons, the imbalance is evened out with a strike of lightining. Lightining is a lot of electrons moving very quickly from one spot to another
- The electricity in the flashlight circuit is obviously much better mannered
  than a spark or a lightning bolt. The light burns steadily and continuously
  because the electrons aren't just jumping from one place to another. As one
  atom in the circuit loses an electron to another atom nearby, it grabs another
  electron from an adjacent atom, which grabs an electron from another adjacent atom, and so on. The electricity in the circuit is the passage of electrons from atom to atom.
- In all batteries, chemical reactions take place, which means that some
  molecules break down into other molecules, or molecules combine to form
  new molecules.
- The chemicals in batteries are chosen so that the reactions
  between them generate spare electrons on the side of the battery marked with
  a minus sign (called the negative terminal, or anode) and demand extra electrons on the other side of the battery (the positive terminal, or cathode). In
  this way, chemical energy is converted to electrical energy
- The chemical reaction can't proceed unless there's some way that the
  extra electrons can be taken away from the negative terminal of the battery
  and delivered back to the positive terminal. So if the battery isn't connected
  to anything, nothing much happens. (Actually the chemical reactions still
  take place, but very slowly.) The reactions take place only if an electrical
  circuit is present to take electrons away from the negative side and supply
  electrons to the positive side. The electrons travel around this circuit in a
  counterclockwise direction
- We normally like to think of a battery as providing electricity to a circuit.
  But we've seen that we can also think of a circuit as providing a way for a
  battery's chemical reactions to take place. The circuit takes electrons away
  from the negative end of the battery and delivers them to the positive end
  of the battery. The reactions in the battery proceed until all the chemicals
  are exhausted, at which time you throw away the battery or recharge it.
- The ability of an element to carry electricity is related to its subatomic structure.
  Electrons orbit the nucleus in various levels, called shells. An atom that
  has just one electron in its outer shell can readily give up that electron, which
  is what's necessary to carry electricity. These substances are conducive to
  carrying electricity and thus are said to be conductors. The best conductors
  are copper, silver, and gold
- The opposite of conductance is resistance. Some substances arc more
  resistant to the passage of electricity than others, and these are known as
  resistors. If a substance has a very high resistance-meaning that it doesn't
  conduct electricity much at all-it's known as an insulator
- What docs it mean when a battery has 1 .5 volts?
- Actually, voltage-named after Count Alessandro Volta ( 1 745-1 827), who invented the first battery in 1 800-is one of the
  more difficult concepts of elementary electricity. Voltage refers to a potential for doing work. Voltage exists whether or not something is hooked up to a battery
  - In electricity, you can calculate how much current is flowing through a
    circuit if you know the voltage and the resistance. Resistance is measured in ohms, named after Georg Simon Ohm (1789-1854), who also propsed the famous Ohm's Law. The law
    states I = E / R,
    where I is traditionally used to represent current in amperes, E is used to represent voltage (electromotic force) and R is resistance
- Here's the trick: Once you have established a common part of the circuit,
  you don't have to use wire for it. You can replace the wire with something
  else. And what you can replace it with is a giant sphere approximately 7900
  miles in diameter made up of metal, rock, water, and organic material, most
  of which is dead. The giant sphere is known to us as Earth.
  - The thickness of wire is measured in American Wire Gauge, or AWG. The
    smaller the AWG number, the thicker the wire and also the less resistance it
    has. The 20-gauge speaker wire you bought has a diameter of about 0.032
    inches and a resistance of about 10 ohms per 1 000 feet, or 1 ohm for the
    1 00-foot round-trip distance between the bedrooms.
