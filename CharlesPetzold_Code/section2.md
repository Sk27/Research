**The prevailing scientific wisdom regarding the workings of electricity is
called the electron theory, which says that electricity derives from the movement of electrons.**

- all matter-the stuff that we can see and feel (usually)-is
made up of extremely small things called atoms. Every atom is composed of three types of particles. 
- These are called neutrons, protons, and electrons
- There are 112 elements, each of which has a particular atomic number ranging from 1 to 112.
- The atomic number indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of each of the element's atoms and also (usually) the number of electrons in each atom. The atomic number of lithium is 3.
- Atoms can chemically combine with other atoms to form #molecules#
- Molecules usually have very different properties from the atoms they comprise
