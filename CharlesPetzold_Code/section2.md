**The prevailing scientific wisdom regarding the workings of electricity is
called the electron theory, which says that electricity derives from the movement of electrons.**

- all matter-the stuff that we can see and feel (usually)-is
made up of extremely small things called atoms. Every atom is composed of three types of particles. 
- These are called neutrons, protons, and electrons
- There are 112 elements, each of which has a particular atomic number ranging from 1 to 112.
- The atomic number indicates the number of protons in the nucleus of each of the element's atoms and also (usually) the number of electrons in each atom. The atomic number of lithium is 3.
- Atoms can chemically combine with other atoms to form molecules
- Molecules usually have very different properties from the atoms they comprise. For example, water is composed of molecules that consist of two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of oxygen (hence, H20). Obviously water
is appreciably different from either hydrogen or oxygen. Likewise, the
molecules of table salt consist of an atom of sodium and an atom of chlorine, neither of which would be particularly appetizing on French fries.
Hydrogen, oxygen, sodium, and chlorine are all elements. Water and salt
are called compounds. Salt water, however, is a mixture rather than a compound because the water and the salt maintain their own properties
- The number of electrons in an atom is usually the same as the number of
protons. But in certain circumstances, electrons can be dislodged from atoms. That's how elecuicity happens.
The words electron and electricity both derive from the ancient Greek
word TJAEKTpov (elektron)
- (elektron) is a Greek word for "amber", which is the glasslike hardended sap of trees. The reason for this
unlikely derivation is that the ancient Greeks experimented with rubbing
amber with wool, which produces something we now call static electricity
- Protons and electtons have a characteristic called charge. Protons arc said
to have a positive (+) charge and electrons are said to have a negative (-)
charge. Neutrons are neutral and have no charge. Protons and electrons are happiest and most stable when they exist together in equal numbers. An imbalance of protons and electrons will attempt
to correct itself
- Static electricity ins't limited to the little sparks produced by fingers touching doorknoobs. During storms, bottom clouds acummulate electrons while upper clouds lose electrons, the imbalance is evened out with a strike of lightining. Lightining is a lot of electrons moving very quickly from one spot to another
- The electricity in the flashlight circuit is obviously much better mannered
than a spark or a lightning bolt. The light burns steadily and continuously
because the electrons aren't just jumping from one place to another. As one
atom in the circuit loses an electron to another atom nearby, it grabs another
electron from an adjacent atom, which grabs an electron from another adjacent atom, and so on. The electricity in the circuit is the passage of electrons from atom to atom. 
- In all batteries, chemical reactions take place, which means that some
molecules break down into other molecules, or molecules combine to form
new molecules.
- The chemicals in batteries are chosen so that the reactions
between them generate spare electrons on the side of the battery marked with
a minus sign (called the negative terminal, or anode) and demand extra electrons on the other side of the battery (the positive terminal, or cathode). In
this way, chemical energy is converted to electrical energy
